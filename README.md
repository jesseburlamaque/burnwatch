# ðŸ”¥ Burn Watch - FIRMS Fire Data Viewer
> This project is **experimental** and was developed for exploratory purposes only.

https://burn-watch.netlify.app  
This project is an **interactive experiment** built with React and Leaflet for visualizing fire hotspots detected by **MODIS** and **VIIRS (S-NPP, NOAA-20, NOAA-21)** sensors, using data from the FIRMS (NASA) platform accessed via `API`.

The goal was to **explore the integration between `React`, `Leaflet`, and public satellite monitoring `APIs`**.

## Features

- Displays the most recent fire hotspots (last few days)
- Filters hotspots **within a specific geographic area (ROI)** defined by a GeoJSON file
- Custom icons for each sensor type (MODIS, VIIRS)
- Automatic zoom adjustment based on the ROI area
- Explanatory legend with the sensors used
